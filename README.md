 # Snake Game (js code documentation)

This code implements a simple Snake Game using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas.
Variables

   blocksize: The size of each block on the game board (pixels).
    rows: The number of rows on the game board.
    cols: The number of columns on the game board.
    board: The HTML canvas element representing the game board.
    context: The 2D rendering context of the game board.
    snakeX, snakeY: The current position of the snake's head (in pixels).
    velocityX, velocityY: The current velocity of the snake's head (controls the direction of movement).
    gameOver: A boolean flag indicating whether the game is over or not.
    snakeBody: An array representing the segments of the snake's body.
    foodX, foodY: The position of the food on the game board (in pixels).

Game Initialization

The game is initialized when the window.onload event is triggered. The following steps are performed:

   The game board element is obtained from the HTML document using its ID (board).
    The size of the game board is set based on the number of rows and columns and the block size.
    The rendering context of the game board is obtained (context).
    The initial position of the food is set by calling the placeFood function.
    An event listener is added to the document to handle the keyup event, which triggers the changeDirection function.
    The update function is called repeatedly at a fixed interval (1/10th of a second) using setInterval.

Game Update

The update function is responsible for updating the game state and rendering it on the game board. The following steps are performed:

   If the game is over, the function returns early.
    The game board is cleared by filling it with a black color.
    The food is drawn on the game board using a red color.
    If the snake's head overlaps with the food, the snake's body grows by adding a new segment and a new food position is generated.
    The snake's body segments are updated by shifting each segment forward in the array.
    The snake's head position is updated based on the current velocity.
    The snake's head and body segments are drawn on the game board using a lime color.
    Collision detection is performed to check if the snake has hit the walls or its own body. If so, the game is over, and an alert is displayed.
    The function ends.

Direction Change

The changeDirection function is called when the keyup event is triggered. It updates the velocity of the snake's head based on the arrow keys pressed.
Food Placement

The placeFood function is responsible for generating random positions for the food on the game board within the valid range of rows and columns.

This code provides a basic implementation of a Snake Game. You can modify and extend it further to add features like scoring, levels, and additional game mechanics.

Note: The code assumes that there is an HTML file with a canvas element having the ID "board" where the game is rendered.

Hope this documentation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
